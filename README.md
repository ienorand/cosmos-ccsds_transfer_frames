# Cosmos::CcsdsTransferFrameProtocol

This gem contains a CCSDS transfer frame protocol for use with the Ball Aerospace COSMOS application.

The protocol extracts CCSDS space packets from CCSDS transfer frames, optionally prefixing each packe with the transfer frame headers of the frame where it started.

## Installation

This gem is intended to be installed as a 'gem based target/tool' (see http://cosmosrb.com/docs/gemtargets/) in COSMOS and made available for use as a normal protocol in a target command and telemetry server configuration. Note that the protocol provided in this gem is neither a target nor a tool in the COSMOS sense.

In order to make this protocol available for use in your COSMOS targets, add this line to the Gemfile of your COSMOS project:

```ruby
gem 'cosmos-ccsds_transfer_frames'
```

and then execute

```sh
$ bundle
```

## Usage

In order to use this protocol in your COSMOS target add it in the command and telemetry server configuration as an extra protocol in an interface definition, for example:

```
INTERFACE INTERFACE_NAME tcpip_client_interface.rb localhost 12345 12345 10.0 nil
  PROTOCOL CcsdsTranferFrameProtocol 1115 0 true true
  TARGET TARGET_NAME
```

which would set up the protocol to expect transfer frames with:

* A total size of 1115 bytes.
* No secondary header.
* Operational control field.
* Frame error control field.
* No prefixing of packets (default).
* Discarding of idle packets (default).

For detailed information about the available configuration parameters for the protocol, please consult the yard inline source code documentation in `lib/cosmos/interfaces/protocols/ccsds_transfer_frame_protocol.rb`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in the gemspec file, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
